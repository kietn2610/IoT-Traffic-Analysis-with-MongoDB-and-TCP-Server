# IoT Traffic Route Optimization with MongoDB and Google Cloud

This project involves adapting Python scripts to establish a client-server connection, integrating MongoDB for real-time traffic data analysis from DataNiz, and deploying the solution on Google Cloud to optimize routes based on the least congested freeway within the last five minutes, culminating in a demo and submission of relevant program files and screenshots.
